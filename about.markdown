Hi!

My chosen name is Rai, and my given name is Michal Pokorn√Ω. I'm 26, grew up
in Czech Republic and I've worked as a software engineer at Google Zurich since
March 2016.

I have a bachelor's in general CS from the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics][mff]
of the Charles University in Prague. I started a master's in AI at the very same,
and passed all parts but the "you have to write a thesis" one.
<!-- TODO: stredni skola? -->

You can find me on Telegram as [agentydragon][telegram].
My personal e-mail is `agentydragon@gmail.com`.

I am on GitHub as [agentydragon][github].

I am an [effective altruist][ea] ([Czech][ea-cz]) and I currently aim to give
~10%.

I also have a [LinkedIn account][linkedin] and a [Facebook account][facebook].
I only use LinkedIn for people I worked with and I only use Facebook for people
I know in person.

I hunted a few geocaches:

I try to be a generalist. Some stuff I do or did before:

 * Lots of Google stack in C++, Python. Services, gigabyte-terabyte scale
   pipelines, stuff like that.
 * Web stuff. In the distant past, I used PHP, then Ruby (on Rails and off),
   and I mostly use Python today. Of course, there's JavaScript and its
   offshoots.
 * I sometimes write software that needs a lot of performance.
   I mostly use C or C++ for that, but I also like Go.
 * I also wrote a few desktop things in Java and C#. I'm a bit more competent
   in the latter.

Between 2012 and 2016, I helped organize [KSP][ksp] -- a computer science
seminar for high school students by Charles University.
