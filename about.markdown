Hi!

I'm Michal Pokorn√Ω, a 21-years-old "software" "engineer" from Czech Republic.

I'm a hopefully-final-year computer science undergrad
at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics](http://www.mff.cuni.cz) of
the Charles University in Prague.
<!-- TODO: stredni skola? -->

My personal e-mail is `pok@rny.cz`.
Feel free to shoot me a message about anything!

I am on GitHub as [MichalPokorny](https://github.com/MichalPokorny).

I also have a [LinkedIn account](https://linkedin.com/in/mpokornymff) and
a [Facebook account](https://facebook.com/prvak)
(through I don't use those very much -- if you need a quick response, an e-mail
has a better chance).

I use GPG - [here's my public key](/static/pubkey.gpg).

I try to be a generalist.

 * I write some web stuff every now and then. I like Ruby a lot.
   A few years back, I did some PHP, too.
 * I'm good at C and C++.
 * Finally, in no particular order, I think I'm fairly competent in C#, Java and
   Python.
   I didn't ever write anything production-ready in Haskell, but it's
   something I'd like to try one day.

I help organize [KSP][ksp]  -- a computer science
seminar for high school students by Charles University.
