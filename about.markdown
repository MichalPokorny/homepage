Hi!

I'm Michal Pokorn√Ω, a 22-years-old "software" "engineer" from Czech Republic.

I'm studying a master's in AI at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics][mff]
of the Charles University in Prague.
<!-- TODO: stredni skola? -->

My personal e-mail is `pok@rny.cz`.
Feel free to shoot me a message about anything!

I am on GitHub as [MichalPokorny](https://github.com/MichalPokorny).

I also have a [LinkedIn account][linkedin] and a [Facebook account][facebook]
(through I don't use those very much -- if you need a quick response, an e-mail
has a better chance).

I use GPG - [here's my public key](/static/pubkey.gpg).

I try to be a generalist. Some stuff I do or did before:

 * Web stuff. In the distant past, I used PHP, then Ruby (on Rails and off),
   and I mostly use Python today. Of course, there's JavaScript and its
   offshoots.
 * I sometimes write software that needs a lot of performance.
   I mostly use C or C++ for that, but I also like Go.
 * I also wrote a few desktop things in Java and C#. I'm a bit more competent
   in the latter.

I help organize [KSP][ksp] -- a computer science seminar for high school
students by Charles University.
