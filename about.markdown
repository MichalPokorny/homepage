Hi!

I'm Michal Pokorn√Ω, a 24-years-old "software" "engineer" from Czech Republic.

I work at Google Zurich and might some day get around to finishing
a master's in AI at the [Faculty of Mathematics and Physics][mff]
of the Charles University in Prague.

You can find me on Telegram as [@agentydragon][telegram].
My personal e-mail is `agentydragon@gmail.com`.
Feel free to shoot me a message about anything!

I am on GitHub as [agentydragon][github].

I am an [effective altruist][ea] ([Czech][ea-cz]) and I currently earn to give.
You can take a look at my donations on [My Giving at Giving What We Can][my-giving].

I also have a [LinkedIn account][linkedin] and a [Facebook account][facebook].
I only use LinkedIn for people I worked with and I only use Facebook for people
I consider my friends. If you try to connect with me or add me as a friend
and I have no idea who you are, I'm really sorry to say this, but unfortunately
I'll probably ignore you. I do not mean this personally and this does not mean
that I do not want to be your friend. In general, I want people to be my
friends. It's just my personal preference in how I use social networks. If you
send me a connection request and I ignore it, I will probably feel guilty about
it.

From time to time, I hunt for geocaches.

I try to be a generalist. Some stuff I do or did before:

 * Web stuff. In the distant past, I used PHP, then Ruby (on Rails and off),
   and I mostly use Python today. Of course, there's JavaScript and its
   offshoots.
 * I sometimes write software that needs a lot of performance.
   I mostly use C or C++ for that, but I also like Go.
 * I also wrote a few desktop things in Java and C#. I'm a bit more competent
   in the latter.

Between 2012 and 2016, I helped organize [KSP][ksp] -- a computer science
seminar for high school students by Charles University.
