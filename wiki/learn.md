title: Things to learn
---

There's a lot of concepts and math things and programming thingies that I want
to learn about and understand some day, but they keep popping up faster than
I can keep up. This is the last iteration of my attempts to systematize those.

The way I intend to this page is that I dump things that I want to understand
here, and some day, I hopefully come to the page, spend a couple hours
studying, and write down my own understanding of them and link to it.
That way hopefully if I ever forget what those things are or how they work, I
can go back to them digested right for the way my mind works, and optimize
them.

Also, prioritizing those has become a problem. I don't have a systematic
solution for that so far.
